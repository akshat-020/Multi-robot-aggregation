# Multi-robot-aggregation

# Project Overview
In this project we would learn algorithms like A*, APF,dijkstra and implement the most convinient on multiple robots to form swarms.

Multi-agent aggregation: Multi-robot aggregation at a predefined target without communicating about their 
states like global positions
switching mode controller: Switching mode controller means the bot switches between two control algos i.e.  free and engaged system. 
collision avoidance: Using the algorithm to avoid the static obstacles(objects) and as well as the other bots.
local sensing: Sensing of the data using the lidar sensors on the TURTLEBOT3.


Various trials of the controller uploaded in the folder scripts
Final code is the trial8.py
